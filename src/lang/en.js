    aboutUsContent1: 'Since 2006, Volkswagen Group China has taken a series of practical legal' +
      ' measures against production and distribution of counterfeit parts damaging the Volkswagen' +
      ' brand and Volkswagen consumers’ interests. To a certain extent, these measures have ' +
      'effectively curbed the spreading of infringement and counterfeiting, purified the' +
      ' aftermarket and safeguarded the commercial interests of the Volkswagen brand.',
    aboutUsContent2: 'However, as consumers to whom counterfeit parts are sold do not have ' +
      'enough knowledge of auto parts, cannot accurately identify counterfeit auto parts and ' +
      'are sensitive to prices, offenders producing and selling counterfeit parts still have ' +
      'some room in the market and they continue to damage consumers’ interests by deception. ' +
      'On the other hand, consumers think counterfeit parts are not shoddy and are acceptable' +
      ' as long as no safety problems are caused, so they have a one- sided and wrong perception' +
      ' of Volkswagen’s genuine parts.',
    aboutUsContent3: 'The brand protection project is designed to analyze and make known the impacts' +
      ' of counterfeit parts on car owners’ safety, health and properties through the comparison of ' +
      'the performance between genuine parts and counterfeit parts, in order to raise consumers’ ' +
      'awareness of the importance to buy genuine products and contain infringement, effectively ' +

      ' though they are aware of the existence of counterfeits, they are not alert to the real danger of' +
      ' using one, let alone being able to tell a genuine product from a fake one. That’s also one of the' +
      ' main reasons for the prevalence of counterfeits. Meanwhile, the majority of fake parts circulating' +
      ' on the market end up in cars through suspicious independent workshops. Purchasing genuine OEM parts' +
